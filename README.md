# Engage - Beast Mode Debugging!

Engage is meant as a custom lightweight container image meant for providing a go-to debugging/troubleshooting environment in multiple scenarios.
View the [`Dockerfile`](https://github.com/InAnimaTe/docker-engage/blob/master/Dockerfile) to see everything installed (i.e. dig, curl, telnet, psql, nmap, and more!).

*Run Locally:*

```
docker run --name engage inanimate/engage
docker exec -it engage /bin/bash
```

*In Kubernetes:*

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/deployment.yaml
```

> Other objects exist in `deploy/` like ingress, pdb, and service!

## Optional Variables

* `PORT` - Defines the HTTP listen port for `echo-server`, defaults to 80
* `SSLPORT` - Defines the HTTPS listen port for `echo-server`, defaults to 443
* `SSHPORT` - Defines the SSH Daemon listen port for ssh connections, defaults to 22
* `TZ` - Set the timezone, standard zones from `tzdata` package supported i.e. `America/Detroit`

See below for more optional variables depending on how you want to use Engage!

## Echo Server

Additionally, https://github.com/inanimate/echo-server is included which provides a simple http server that prints out basic details and other useful troubleshooting information.

Snippet of example output when you `curl localhost`:
```
Welcome to echo-server!  Here's what I know.
  > Head to /ws for interactive websocket echo!

-> My hostname is: echo-server-4282639374-6bvzg

-> My Pod Name is: echo-server-4282639374-6bvzg
-> My Pod Namespace is: playground
-> My Pod IP is: 10.2.1.30

-> Requesting IP: 10.2.2.0:40974
.......
```

This is immensely helpful when testing ingress flows through load balancers, verifying network policies, and other introspective details of the environment a container runs in! It also provides a Websocket connection for further testing.

## HTTPSTAT (Curl on Steroids!)

Another utility, `httpstat` is also included (the go version: https://github.com/davecheney/httpstat) which gives you amazing http response details.

```
bash-4.4# httpstat google.com

## DROPUSER Configuration

`docker-engage` allows you to drop privileges by creating a non-root user at runtime. This is done by setting several environment variables that will update `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`. When these variables are supplied, the containerâ€™s startup script automatically creates the user and grants passwordless `sudo` privileges.

> *Note this functionality is entirely optional. Merely cease passing any of these variables and use `root` by default.*

### Environment Variables

- **`DROPUSER` (required):**  
  The username that will be created inside the container.  
  _Example:_ `inanimate`

- **`DU_UID` (required):**  
  The user ID (UID) for the new user.  
  _Example:_ `1000`

- **`DU_GID` (required):**  
  The group ID (GID) for the new user's primary group.  
  _Example:_ `1000`

- **`DU_PASS` (optional):**  
  An optional password to set for the $DROPUSER, default is `engage`  
  _Example:_ `plzdonthackme`

- **`DROPGROUP` (optional):**  
  The name of the group to be created. If not provided, the group name defaults to the value of `DROPUSER`.

### How It Works

When the required environment variables are set, the container's `run` script will perform the following steps:

1. **Create a Group:**  
   A group is created with the specified GID. If the `DROPGROUP` variable is provided, that group name is used; otherwise, it defaults to the `DROPUSER` value.

2. **Create a User:**  
   A new user is created with the specified UID and primary group using the following options:
   - **`-N`**: Do not create a group with the same name as the user.
   - **`-M`**: Do not create a home directory.
   - **`-s /bin/zsh`**: Set the login shell to Zsh.
  
   The home directory will be set to the default of `/home/$DROPUSER`. Mount any storage you want to be persistent for this user to this directory.

3. **Grant Sudo Privileges:**  
   A sudoers file is created that grants the new user passwordless `sudo` access. `su` is also enabled.

*Protip:* Use `sudo -E -s` instead of `sudo su` to launch a root shell which maintains the `$DROPUSER`'s environment (`$HOME`, `$SHELL`, etc.).

### Example Usage

You can pass these environment variables when running your container. For example, using Docker:

```bash
docker run \
  -e DROPUSER=inanimate \
  -e DU_UID=1000 \
  -e DU_GID=1000 \
  -e DROPGROUP=king \
  inanimate/engage:latest
```

## Loop Mode

Engage can take a `command` you give it (i.e. via `docker-compose`) and run it
in a while loop with interval `$LOOPINTERVAL` for you!

To enable set both these environment variables (LOOPINTERVAL is any accepted timeframe `sleep` supports),
```
LOOPMODE=enabled
LOOPINTERVAL=10000s
```

and pass your desired script or one-liner for immediate execution and recurring execution every `$LOOPINTERVAL`

An example `command`:
```
docker run -ti inanimate/engage 'export NICEDATE=`date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M"` && echo "starting backup with date $NICEDATE"'
```

This is especially useful if you need to run continuous checks on a process, make simple backup patterns, or have other fun usecases!

> Note, the loop will continue indefinitely as `while true` does. Please ensure you kill the process to stop your desired script from continually running!
